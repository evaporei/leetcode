# reverse-linked-list

1. First you should have two variables, one to hold the result, the other a pointer that will traverse the linked list once;
2. Then you should make the pointer point to the next node/element. While making the local node variable point to the result, which will be empty or hold the previous element;
3. At last the result binding should look at the switched node.
